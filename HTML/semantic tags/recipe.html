    <h1> How to bake classic fudgy brownies</h1>
    <p>Prep the pan and oven: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and line an 8x8-inch pan with parchment paper.
        Melt the chocolate and butter: In a microwave-safe bowl, melt butter and semisweet chocolate chips together.
        Stir every 20 seconds until smooth, then let it cool slightly.
        Combine wet ingredients: Whisk sugar and eggs into the cooled butter-chocolate mixture until fully incorporated.
        Add dry ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, and salt. Fold the dry
        ingredients into the wet mixture until just combined, being careful not to overmix.
        Bake: Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 35–40 minutes. The brownies are done when the edges are
        set and the center still looks slightly underbaked.
        Cool completely: For the best fudgy and clean-cut slices, allow the brownies to cool completely in the pan
        before cutting. This can take up to two hours.</p>
