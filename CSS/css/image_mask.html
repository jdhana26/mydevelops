        <h1>About Cricket</h1>
        <p><b>Cricket is a globally loved bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players each on a large
                ground with a rectangular pitch in the center. The game begins with one team batting and the other
                bowling and fielding. The batting side aims to score runs by hitting the ball and running between the
                wickets, or by striking boundaries that fetch four runs if the ball reaches the boundary line and six
                runs if it crosses without touching the ground. The bowling side works to dismiss the batsmen through
                methods such as bowling the stumps, catching the ball, or running them out. After a set number of overs
                or when all the batsmen are dismissed, the teams switch roles. The team with the highest total runs wins
                the match. Cricket requires skill and patience from batsmen, accuracy and variation from bowlers, and
                alertness from fielders. With formats ranging from the short T20 matches to the longer Test matches,
                cricket combines strategy, endurance, and excitement, making it a sport enjoyed by millions worldwide.
