        <h1>About Kabbadi</h1>
        <p><b>Kabaddi is a traditional sport that combines strength, agility, and strategy, played between two teams on
                a rectangular court. The game revolves around raiding and defending. One player from the attacking team,
                called the raider, enters the opponent’s half of the court with the aim of tagging as many defenders as
                possible before returning safely to his side. The raider must hold his breath and continuously chant the
                word “kabaddi” during the raid. If the raider successfully tags opponents and returns, his team scores
                points, but if the defenders manage to catch and hold him until he loses breath or fails to cross back,
                the defending team scores instead. Teams take turns sending raiders, and the match continues until time
                runs out. The side with the highest score wins. Kabaddi demands both mental and physical strength, as
                raiders need quick thinking and swift movements, while defenders must work together with timing and
                power to trap the raider. It is a game full of energy, tension, and excitement that keeps both players
                and spectators deeply engaged. </b></p>
