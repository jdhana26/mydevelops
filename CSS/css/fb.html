        <h1>About Football</h1>
        <p><b>Football, also known as soccer, is a game played between two teams, each aiming to score goals by sending the
            ball into the opponentâ€™s net. A standard match is played for ninety minutes, divided into two halves of
            forty-five minutes each, with a short break in between. Each team consists of eleven players, including one
            goalkeeper who is the only player allowed to use hands, and that too only inside the penalty area. The match
            begins with a kick-off at the center of the field, and from then on, players move the ball by passing,
            dribbling, or shooting, while the opponents try to block, tackle, and defend their goal. The main rule is
            that players must not use their hands, and they must also avoid fouls such as pushing or tripping. When the
            ball goes out of play, it is restarted with a throw-in, corner, or goal kick, depending on where it crossed
            the line. The team that scores the most goals by the end of the match is declared the winner. To play
            football well, one must learn how to pass accurately, dribble with control, shoot with power, and defend
            strongly, but above all, teamwork and communication are the keys to success on the field. </b></p>
