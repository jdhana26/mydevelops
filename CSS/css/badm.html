        <h1>About Badminton</h1>
        <p><b>Badminton is a fast-paced indoor sport played with racquets and a shuttlecock between either two players
                in singles or two teams of two in doubles. The court is rectangular and divided by a net, with players
                positioned on opposite sides. The objective is to hit the shuttlecock over the net in such a way that it
                lands inside the opponent’s court, making it difficult for them to return. A rally continues until the
                shuttlecock touches the ground, goes out of bounds, or fails to cross the net. Each rally won gives a
                point, and the game is generally played up to twenty-one points, requiring a player or team to win by at
                least two points. Badminton requires excellent footwork, fast reflexes, and precise shot-making, with
                common strokes including smashes, drops, clears, and net shots. The game demands not only physical
                stamina but also clever placement and strategy, as players must anticipate their opponent’s moves and
                respond with speed. Badminton is admired for its mixture of elegance, agility, and competitive spirit,
                making it a favorite sport across the world. </b></p>
